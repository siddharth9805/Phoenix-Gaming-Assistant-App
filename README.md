### Overview
Our project aims at allowing users to play android games using only their speech. We will be using speech-to-text technology to achieve this task. First, the user will place a ‘pressure point’ that is, a point on the screen whose coordinates are saved by the app. When the player speaks
the word ‘porcupine’, a touch event will be executed at the pressure points location thus, making the game deal as if someone is playing with their fingers.
Our aim is to help specially-abled players, get an equally immersive experience as that of normal players. Also, we plan to release this app on the Google Playstore in the coming future to allow anyone with an android device to play.
